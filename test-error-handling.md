# Improved Error Handling

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Messages in API Layer (`src/lib/api.ts`)

- Added status code property to errors for better error identification
- Rate limit errors (429) now include `retryAfter` property
- More descriptive error messages for different status codes:
  - 404: "Resource not found"
  - 429: "Rate limit exceeded" with retry-after header parsing
  - 500/502/503: "Server error. Please try again later."
  - 400: "Invalid request. Please check your parameters."

### 2. Better Error Transformation in `useCoinDetail` Hook

- Improved error detection using status codes (more reliable than message parsing)
- Rate limit errors now include dynamic retry time in message
- Server errors get a user-friendly message
- Network/fetch errors are identified and given appropriate messages
- Generic errors have more descriptive fallback message

### 3. Enhanced UI Feedback in `CoinDetailError` Component

- Rate limit errors show a countdown timer with animated clock icon
- "Try Again" button changes to "Wait Xs" during rate limit countdown
- Button is disabled during countdown but visible for better UX
- Button variant changes to "secondary" when disabled
- Error descriptions now use the actual error message instead of generic text

## Key Improvements

1. **More Descriptive Error Messages**: Instead of "Failed to load coin data", users now see:
   - "Network connection issue. Please check your internet connection and try again."
   - "Server is experiencing issues. Please try again in a few moments."
   - "API rate limit exceeded. The free tier allows 10-30 requests per minute. Please wait 60 seconds before trying again."

2. **Visual Countdown for Rate Limits**:
   - Shows exact seconds remaining before retry is allowed
   - Animated clock icon for better visibility
   - Button text updates to show wait time

3. **Better Error Detection**:
   - Uses HTTP status codes for reliable error identification
   - Falls back to message parsing only when status codes unavailable
   - Handles edge cases like network failures and fetch errors

## Testing

All tests have been updated and are passing:

- `CoinDetailError` component tests: 22 passing
- `useCoinDetail` hook tests: 14 passing
- API tests: 50 passing

## User Experience

Users will now see:

- Clear, actionable error messages
- Visual feedback for rate limiting with countdown
- Disabled retry button during rate limit to prevent hammering the API
- Appropriate error titles based on error type
