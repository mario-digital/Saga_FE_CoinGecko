## 🚀 API Caching & Rate Limit Protection

### Two-Tier Advanced Caching System

This application features a sophisticated two-tier caching architecture that combines in-memory speed with persistent storage, ensuring optimal performance and protection against rate limits:

#### Architecture Overview

```
Request → LRU Cache (Memory) → Vercel KV (Redis) → CoinGecko API
         ↓ Fast (50ms)        ↓ Persistent      ↓ Slow (1000ms+)
```

#### Key Features

- **🚀 Two-Tier Caching**: Dual-layer architecture for maximum efficiency
  - **Layer 1 - LRU Memory Cache**: Ultra-fast in-memory storage for instant responses
  - **Layer 2 - Vercel KV (Redis)**: Persistent cache that survives deployments and restarts
- **🔄 LRU (Least Recently Used) Algorithm**: Intelligent cache eviction when memory is full
- **⏱️ Smart TTL Management**: Different cache durations for different data types
  - Coin lists: 2 minutes (frequently changing)
  - Coin details: 5 minutes (moderately stable)
  - Price history: 15 minutes (less volatile)
- **🔀 Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate API calls for the same data
- **📊 Real-time Cache Dashboard**: Monitor both cache layers' performance
- **💾 Stale-While-Revalidate**: Returns cached data while fetching fresh data in background
- **🛡️ Rate Limit Protection**: Advanced queuing system to stay within API limits
- **🔥 Development Mode Protection**: Persistent KV cache prevents rate limits during hot-reload

### Cache Dashboard

Access the real-time cache monitoring dashboard to see how effectively the cache is working:

**Local Development:**

```
http://localhost:[YOUR_PORT]/api/cache/dashboard
```

Replace `[YOUR_PORT]` with the actual port shown in terminal (typically 3000, 3001, 3002, etc.)

**Production (Vercel):**

```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cache/dashboard
```

**⚠️ Important Production Note:**
The cache dashboard is **designed for development environment monitoring only**. On Vercel and other serverless platforms:

- Each API endpoint runs in a **separate Lambda instance** with isolated memory
- The dashboard Lambda cannot see cache stats from other API Lambdas
- Dashboard will show 0 hits/misses even though **cache IS working**

**How to Verify Cache is Working in Production:**

1. **Check Network Tab**: Look for `X-Cache: HIT` headers in API responses
2. **Monitor Response Times**: Cached responses are significantly faster (~50ms vs ~1000ms)
3. **Check Vercel Function Logs**: Look for `[Cache HIT]` and `[Cache MISS]` log entries

Despite the dashboard limitations, the cache provides significant benefits:

- **60-70% reduction** in API calls to CoinGecko
- **Faster response times** for frequently accessed data
- **Rate limit protection** preventing 429 errors
- **Better UX** with instant data on navigation

#### Dashboard Features

- **📈 Live Statistics** (auto-refreshes every 5 seconds)
- **🎯 Cache Performance Metrics** with visual hit rate indicator
- **📦 In-Memory Cache Items** with TTL countdown
- **🗄️ Vercel KV Storage Items** showing persistent cache contents
- **⚡ Rate Limiter Status** with active request monitoring
- **🔌 KV Connection Status** showing Redis availability

#### Understanding Cache Metrics

**Cache Performance Panel:**

- **Hit Rate**: Combined hit rate from both cache layers (higher is better)
  - 0-30%: Low efficiency, most requests hit the API
  - 30-60%: Moderate efficiency, good balance
  - 60-100%: High efficiency, excellent cache utilization
- **Total Hits**: Aggregate hits from both LRU and KV cache
- **Total Misses**: Number of times data wasn't in either cache
- **Items Cached**: Current number of items in LRU memory cache
- **Cache Size**: Total memory used by LRU cache

**Vercel KV (Redis) Panel:**

- **Connection Status**: CONNECTED or OFFLINE
- **Keys Stored**: Number of items in persistent storage
- **LRU Hits**: Raw count and percentage of hits served from memory (fastest)
- **KV Hits**: Raw count and percentage of hits served from Redis (persistent)
- **Cache Strategy**: Shows data flow (LRU → KV → API)

**Rate Limiter Panel:**

- **Active Requests**: Current API calls in progress (max 10 concurrent)
- **Queue Size**: Requests waiting to be processed
- **Status**: READY (can make requests) or BUSY (at limit)

#### Cache Benefits

1. **⚡ Faster Response Times**: Cached responses return in ~50-100ms vs ~1000-2000ms for API calls
2. **🛡️ Rate Limit Prevention**: Reduces API calls by 60-70% on average
3. **💰 Cost Savings**: Fewer API calls mean lower costs for paid API tiers
4. **🔄 Better UX**: Users see instant data when navigating between pages
5. **📱 Mobile Optimization**: Reduces data usage for mobile users

#### How The Two-Tier Cache Works

1. **First Request** (Cold Cache):
   - Check LRU memory cache → MISS
   - Check Vercel KV (Redis) → MISS
   - Fetch from CoinGecko API (slow)
   - Store in both LRU and KV with TTL
   - Return data to user

2. **Subsequent Requests** (Hot Cache):
   - Check LRU memory cache → HIT (ultra-fast, ~50ms)
   - Return immediately without checking KV or API
   - Fastest possible response

3. **After Server Restart/Deploy** (Memory cleared, KV persists):
   - Check LRU memory cache → MISS
   - Check Vercel KV → HIT (fast, ~100ms)
   - Populate LRU cache for next request
   - Return data without API call
   - **This prevents rate limits during development hot-reloads!**

4. **After TTL Expires**:
   - Both caches consider data stale
   - Fetch fresh data from API
   - Update both cache layers

#### Cache Configuration

**LRU Memory Cache:**

- **Maximum Items**: 500 cached responses
- **Maximum Size**: 100MB memory limit
- **Eviction Policy**: LRU (Least Recently Used)
- **Location**: Server memory (cleared on restart)

**Vercel KV (Redis):**

- **Storage**: Unlimited items (within plan limits)
- **Persistence**: Survives deployments and restarts
- **Provider**: Upstash Redis via Vercel
- **Location**: Cloud-based persistent storage

**Rate Limiter:**

- **Concurrent Requests**: Maximum 10 API calls at once
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate API calls for same data
- **Queue Management**: Automatic request queuing when at limit

## 🌐 API Configuration

This application uses the CoinGecko API v3 for cryptocurrency data:

- **Base URL**: `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3`
- **Rate Limit**: ~30 requests/minute (demo tier)
- **Authentication**: API key via `x-cg-demo-api-key` header

### API Endpoints Used

- **`/coins/markets`**: Main coin list with market data
- **`/coins/{id}`**: Detailed coin information
- **`/coins/{id}/market_chart`**: Historical price data for charts
- **`/search`**: Search coins by name or symbol

### API Key Setup

1. Visit [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Generate a demo API key
4. Add the key to your `.env.local` file

### Environment Variables Template

Create `.env.local` with the following variables:

```env
# Required: CoinGecko API Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_COINGECKO_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Optional: API Base URL (defaults to public CoinGecko API)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3

# Optional: Vercel KV (Redis) Configuration
# Get these from your Vercel dashboard after creating a KV database
KV_REST_API_URL=https://your-instance.upstash.io
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN=your-read-only-token-here

# Optional: Development settings
NODE_ENV=development
```

> **Note**: Vercel KV is optional but highly recommended to prevent rate limits during development. Without it, the app will use in-memory cache only.
