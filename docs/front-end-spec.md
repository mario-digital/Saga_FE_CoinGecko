```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Single-page application with state-based navigation. Main coin list as the primary interface. Coin detail views accessed via card interactions. No traditional menu - focus on content discovery.

**Secondary Navigation:** Search/filter controls prominently placed. Pagination for data browsing. Theme toggle in header area. Historical range selectors within coin details.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Minimal breadcrumbs: "Home > [Coin Name]" for detail views. Clear "back to list" functionality. Maintain scroll position when returning to list.

## User Flows

### Browse and Discover Cryptocurrencies

**User Goal:** Find and explore cryptocurrency data quickly and efficiently

**Entry Points:**

- Direct URL access to homepage
- Returning user with localStorage theme preference
- Search engine or bookmark access

**Success Criteria:**

- User can see cryptocurrency data within 3 seconds
- Can navigate through paginated results smoothly
- Theme preference is remembered across sessions

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User lands on homepage] --> B{Loading state}
    B -->|API Success| C[Display coin grid]
    B -->|API Error| D[Show error with retry]
    C --> E[User scrolls/browses]
    E --> F[User clicks pagination]
    F --> G[Smooth scroll to top + new data]
    E --> H[User clicks coin card]
    H --> I[Navigate to coin details]
    D --> J[User clicks retry]
    J --> B
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- API rate limit exceeded → Show friendly message with retry timer
- Network connectivity issues → Offline indicator with retry option
- Empty API response → "No data available" state with refresh button
- Slow API response → Progressive loading with skeleton states
- Invalid pagination parameters → Reset to page 1 with notification

### Search and Filter Cryptocurrencies

**User Goal:** Find specific cryptocurrencies or narrow down results by criteria

**Entry Points:**

- Search input in header/navigation area
- Filter dropdown/panel access
- Keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl + K) for power users

**Success Criteria:**

- Instant search results as user types
- Clear filter state indication
- Easy reset/clear functionality

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User focuses search input] --> B[Types query]
    B --> C{Query length > 2}
    C -->|Yes| D[Show filtered results]
    C -->|No| E[Show all coins]
    D --> F[User selects filter]
    F --> G[Apply combined search + filter]
    G --> H[Update URL params]
    E --> I[User clears search]
    I --> J[Return to full list]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- No search results found → Helpful "try different keywords" message
- Search query too short → Show hint about minimum characters
- Filter combination returns empty → Suggest alternative filters
- Special characters in search → Proper encoding and validation

### View Cryptocurrency Details

**User Goal:** Get comprehensive information about a specific cryptocurrency

**Entry Points:**

- Click coin card from main list
- Direct URL access to coin detail page
- Browser back/forward navigation

**Success Criteria:**

- Detailed data loads within 2 seconds
- Historical chart renders correctly
- User can easily return to main list

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User clicks coin card] --> B[Navigate to /coinId]
    B --> C{Coin data available}
    C -->|Yes| D[Show coin details]
    C -->|No| E[Show loading spinner]
    E --> F{API Response}
    F -->|Success| D
    F -->|Error| G[Show error state]
    D --> H[User selects time range]
    H --> I[Update chart data]
    D --> J[User clicks back]
    J --> K[Return to list at same position]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:

- Invalid coin ID → 404 page with search suggestions
- Chart data unavailable → Show price data without chart
- Historical data incomplete → Display available range only
- User navigates with browser buttons → Maintain proper state

- **Monospace:** ui-monospace, 'SF Mono' (for price displays)

#### Type Scale

| Element | Size            | Weight | Line Height |
| ------- | --------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| H1      | 2.25rem (36px)  | 700    | 1.2         |

### Iconography

**Icon Library:** Lucide React (integrates seamlessly with shadcn/ui)

**Usage Guidelines:** Use 16px icons for inline text, 20px for buttons, 24px for emphasis. Maintain consistent stroke width of 2px.

### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** CSS Grid with 12-column layout, responsive breakpoints

**Spacing Scale:** 4px base unit (0.25rem) following Tailwind's spacing scale

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target

**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with enhanced focus on financial data accessibility

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**

- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Focus indicators: 2px solid blue ring with 2px offset
- Text sizing: Minimum 16px, scalable to 200% without horizontal scrolling

**Interaction:**

- Keyboard navigation: Full keyboard accessibility, logical tab order
- Screen reader support: Proper ARIA labels, live regions for dynamic content
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px touch targets on mobile

**Content:**

- Alternative text: All coin logos include descriptive alt text
- Heading structure: Logical heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Form labels: All form inputs properly labeled and associated

### Testing Strategy

Automated testing with axe-core, manual keyboard navigation testing, screen reader testing with NVDA/VoiceOver for cryptocurrency data presentation.

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices              |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| Mobile     | 320px     | 767px     | Phones, small tablets       |
| Tablet     | 768px     | 1023px    | Tablets, small laptops      |
| Desktop    | 1024px    | 1439px    | Laptops, desktop monitors   |
| Wide       | 1440px    | -         | Large monitors, 4K displays |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** 4-col → 2-col → 1-col grid for coin cards. Stack chart and stats vertically on mobile.

**Navigation Changes:** Hamburger menu for mobile, inline search on desktop, bottom navigation for primary actions on mobile.

**Content Priority:** Hide less critical data on smaller screens, show abbreviated coin names, prioritize price and percentage changes.

**Interaction Changes:** Touch-friendly tap targets, swipe gestures for pagination on mobile, hover states disabled on touch devices.

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles

Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance usability without causing distraction. All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` user preferences.

### Key Animations

- **Card Hover:** Scale(1.02) transformation (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Page Transitions:** Fade in content (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Loading States:** Pulse animation for skeletons (Duration: 1s, Easing: ease-in-out, infinite)
- **Price Changes:** Color transition for positive/negative changes (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Chart Interactions:** Smooth line drawing animation (Duration: 500ms, Easing: ease-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds on 3G connection
- **Interaction Response:** < 100ms for UI feedback
- **Animation FPS:** Consistent 60fps for all animations

### Design Strategies

Implement progressive loading with skeleton states, lazy load coin images, optimize chart rendering with canvas/SVG hybrid approach, use shadcn/ui's built-in performance optimizations.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Install and configure shadcn/ui with your existing Tailwind setup
2. Create Figma design file with component library documentation
3. Begin component migration starting with CoinCard using shadcn/ui Card
4. Implement search functionality using shadcn/ui Command component
5. Add comprehensive loading and error states using shadcn/ui components
